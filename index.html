	<h5>U.S. Sales and Refund Policy</h5>
	<p>Thanks for shopping at Apple. We appreciate the fact that you like to buy the cool stuff we build. We also want to make sure you have a rewarding experience while you’re exploring, evaluating, and purchasing our products, whether you’re at the Apple Online Store, in an Apple Retail Store, or on the phone with the Apple Contact Center. (To make it visually easier on both of us, we’ll refer to these entities as the “Apple Store” in this policy.)</p>

	<p>As with any shopping experience, there are terms and conditions that apply to transactions at an Apple Store. We’ll be as brief as our attorneys will allow. The main thing to remember is that by placing an order or making a purchase at an Apple Store, you agree to the terms set forth below along with Apple’s  <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" target="-blank">Privacy Policy</a>  and <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/terms/site.html" target="-blank">Terms of Use</a> .</p>
